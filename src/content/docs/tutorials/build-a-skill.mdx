## Goal

Create a **git-helper** skill that provides Git workflow guidance whenever a task mentions Git-related keywords.

## Step 1: Create the Skill Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/agentloop/vault/skills/git-helper
```

## Step 2: Write SKILL.md

Create `~/.local/share/agentloop/vault/skills/git-helper/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: git-helper
description: Git workflow best practices and conventional commits
triggers:
  - git
  - commit
  - branch
  - merge
  - rebase
---

# Git Helper

When working with Git, follow these conventions:
- Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, chore:
- Create feature branches from main: `git checkout -b feat/description`
- Squash commits before merging
- Write meaningful commit messages explaining WHY, not just WHAT
- Always run tests before committing
- Use `git status` and `git diff` before staging
- Prefer `git add -p` for selective staging over `git add .`
```

### Frontmatter Breakdown

- **`name: git-helper`** — Unique identifier, shown in logs
- **`description`** — Human-readable, for documentation purposes
- **`triggers`** — Any of these keywords in the task text will activate this skill

## Step 3: Restart the Server

Skills are loaded on server startup:

```bash
pm2 restart agentloop-server
```

Check the logs to confirm the skill was loaded:

```bash
pm2 logs agentloop-server --lines 10
```

You should see a log entry indicating the `git-helper` skill was registered.

## Step 4: Test

Run a task that contains a trigger word:

```bash
./agentloop "create a feature branch for the login page"
```

The skill activates because `"branch"` is in the trigger list. The agent now has the Git workflow instructions in its prompt.

## Step 5: Verify

The agent should follow the conventions from the skill:

```bash
# Expected behavior:
# - Creates branch with "feat/" prefix
# - Uses conventional naming
# - Follows the skill's instructions
```

## How It Works

When the task text is processed, `PromptBuilder.DetectSkills()` runs:

1. For each registered skill, check each trigger keyword
2. Matching is case-insensitive substring: `strings.Contains(strings.ToLower("create a feature branch for the login page"), "branch")` → **match**
3. The skill's instructions are injected into the prompt as:

```xml
<skill name="git-helper">
# Git Helper
When working with Git, follow these conventions:
...
</skill>
```

Multiple skills can match the same task. They're all injected.

<Aside type="tip">
  Choose specific trigger words to avoid false matches. For example, use `"git push"` instead of just `"push"` if you only want the skill to activate for Git operations.

## Next Steps

- Add more skills for your common workflows (code review, deployment, testing)
- See [Skills Format Reference](/reference/skills-format/) for the complete SKILL.md specification
- See [Skills Guide](/guides/skills/) for additional examples
