## Step 1: Start the Server

```bash
./agentloop-server &
```

The server creates a Unix socket at `~/.local/share/agentloop/agentloop.sock` and starts listening for JSON-RPC connections.

## Step 2: Health Check

Verify the server is running:

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"health.check","params":{}}' | \
  socat - UNIX-CONNECT:~/.local/share/agentloop/agentloop.sock
```

Expected output:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"status":"ok","activeSessions":0}}
```

## Step 3: Run a Task

```bash
./agentloop "list files in the current directory"
```

You'll see streamed output as the agent works:

```
🔧 bash: ls -la
file1.txt
file2.go
README.md
...
✅ Done (tokens: 1250, tools: 1, duration: 3.2s)
```

The CLI receives events from the server in real time:
- **`event.text`** — Agent's text output, printed directly
- **`event.tool_use`** — Shows which tool is being called (e.g., `bash`, `edit`)
- **`event.done`** — Final result with stats (tokens, tool calls, duration)

## Step 4: Check the Vault

After a task completes, it's automatically saved to the vault:

```bash
ls ~/.local/share/agentloop/vault/sessions/
```

Each session is stored as a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter, compatible with Obsidian:

```
2026-02-27-sess-a1b2c3d4.md
```

## Step 5: Try a More Complex Task

```bash
./agentloop "create a Go function that validates email addresses"
```

For tasks involving potentially dangerous operations, you'll see HITL approval prompts:

```
⚠️ HITL: bash — echo "test@example.com" | grep -E "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@..."
Approve? [y/n/abort]:
```

Type `y` to approve, `n` to deny, or `abort` to cancel the entire task.
